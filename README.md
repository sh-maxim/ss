## Description:
The software tool, SecNet reads a protein sequence in FASTA format and predicts secondary structure. There are several options of the secondary structure label alphabet. Among them are 3 labels (harder Rule #1 or easier Rule #2) and unambigious 8 labels. We also provide 2 new alphabets with 4 and 5 labels. The tool allows selection of one of these 5 alphabets for prediction purposes.

Set2018 data set which includes Test2018 testing set is also available for download. The software runs on python3.
