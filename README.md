## Description:
### SecNet
a software tool which reads a protein sequence in FASTA format and predicts secondary structure. There are several options of the secondary structure label alphabet. Among them are 3 labels (harder Rule #1 or easier Rule #2) and unambiguous 8 labels. We also provide 2 new alphabets with 4 and 5 labels. The tool allows selection of one of these 5 alphabets for prediction purposes.

### Set2018
a rigorously prepared data set, Set2018 which includes training, validation and Test2018 testing sets.

## Operating Systems:

Unix, all flavors
macOS including the recent Catalina 10.15 which dropped support for 32-bit applications

The installer will not disrupt your systemwide or user-specific Python or shell environment or alignment software; instead required Python and its libraries, all 3rd-party software and databases will be installed locally to the SecNet kit directory.
